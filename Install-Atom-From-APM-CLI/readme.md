# Atom Installation Wonder Woman Edition

I used to make a disk image installer for Mac. And while it worked, it was a heavy application to download and install.
And I had to keep updating it as Atom and I evolved. Then I fount this amazing article on how to use
Atom's Package Manager CLI to install Plugins on the fly.

This solves a heck of a lot, but more importantly - make it easier to install on both:

* [Mac](#mac) ...&
* [Windows](#win)


## Mac Install

1. Download and Install [Atom] (https://atom.io/)
2. Open the terminal
3. Run the following command

        apm install --packages-file my_atom_packages.txt

## Windows Install

1. Download and Install [Atom] (https://atom.io/)
2.




### Why Wonder Woman?

My last 2 installers were the following super heroes:

* Iron Man
* Batman

Just seemed fitting she would take on this new approach. And since she saved the DC franchise in the theaters, I think she will hold the space here for quite some time.
