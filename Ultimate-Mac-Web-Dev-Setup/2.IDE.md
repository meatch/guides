## Part 2: Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

## Sublime Text

Out of the box its cool, but the following plugins make it awesome. Only wish you could install a list of plugins from the terminal. The following is the next best thing.

1. Install Sublime Text 3

	https://www.sublimetext.com/3

2. Install Package Control

    https://packagecontrol.io/installation

3. Open Package Control User Settings file

    a. Control + Shift + P
    b. Package Control Settings - User (use fuzzy finder no need to type it all out)

4. Add List of Packages to Sublime Package Control Settings - User

You really only need the list that follows Package Control, but here is what is should look like.

```
{
	"bootstrapped": true,
	"installed_packages":
	[
		"Package Control",
		"A File Icon",
		"AdvancedNewFile",
		"All Autocomplete",
		"AutoFileName",
		"ColorPicker",
		"DocBlockr",
		"Emmet",
		"FileDiffs",
		"Git",
		"GitGutter",
		"MarkdownEditing",
		"Material Theme",
		"Random Everything",
		"Sass",
		"SideBarEnhancements",
		"Terminal"
	]
}

```

4. Restart Sublime Text and Watch it install everything.
