## Part 4: Laravel

# Laravel - PHP Framework
https://laravel.com/

# Composer - Vendor Package Manager
https://getcomposer.org/download/

After Installing

```
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

# Install Laravel
https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/installation

Make sure you have latest version of system requirements. I had to update my PHP and PHP CLI to 7.0. Also had to reprof to get it to work. See installing PHP above.

```
composer global require "laravel/installer" //will create default folder laravel, installs latest version that works with your version of PHP
composer global require "laravel/installer" projectfoldername // create your own folder
composer global require "laravel/installer"=5.5 projectfoldername //choose the version of Laravel you wish to install
composer global require "laravel/installer" . //current directory, does not work if something is already in folder. hidden files too.
```

If Laravel lives in subfolder, read the following. This is also a great way to understand how the structure of Laravel works.
