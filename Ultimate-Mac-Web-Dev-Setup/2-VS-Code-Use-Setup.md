# VS Code

## Switching to a New IDE
I know, I know. I am switching IDE's again.

IDE's are a plenty; and at the end of the day-I see them like surf boards. I don't surf. I just know that there are different surfboards - and the surfers I have talked to say surfboards do make a difference, but, really, its the surfer that does the surfing. Feel the same way about IDE's. You will find the one that gets you where you want to go faster. Try them all, and see which one fits. Like surfboards, not every IDE is created equal. My colleagues recommended I try VS Code. After resisting (mostly cause it is built by Windows - I know we all have our biases), I finally moved away from Sublime Text and Atom. Both are amazing apps and paved the way for VS Code. 

## VS Code is:
1. Open source (So is ATOM, and a good contendor)
2. Works out of the box. The other editors require a lot of initial setup to make them go.  As an instructor this decreases the barrier to entry. Setting up students that have never used an IDE (or touched code) a complicated setup process creates more overwhelm, anxiety, and confusion. When you are learning something new overwhelm, anxiety, and confusion are a default. We fear the unknown, and its my job to build trust and inspire students to code. By simplifying the process, students will feel more confident, and can focus on coding and completing the homework. 
3. Hella-fast. Sublime Text 3 is fast. For some reason Atom is sluggish in comparison (not sure why-I can just feel it). 
4. Feels like home. As a full-stack developer PHP Storm looked attractive as well, but VS Code seems to have all of its features, and after test driving both felt more like home for me.
5. One of the school's I teach at makes it really challenging to install software (too much red tape). VS Code was already approved and installed.

## VS Code Plugin Essentials
Out of the box (unlike other open source IDE's) VS Code just works. The rest is personal preferences and augmentation.
That said, you may see some cool things in my editor that are not in yours. The following is how I got there.
Think of it like driving my car. You will want to adjust the seat, mirrors, etc, to fit your needs.

### HTML, CSS, and JS

You can cherry pick the ones you like. Pretty much installing all of them will set you up. I think I omitted one or 2, but all of em are good. Just personal preference.

#### x-debug for debugging PHP (optional)
PHP debugging is a little more involved then JavaScript. This is not 'cause of VS Code, but because PHP is server-side. To debug PHP, you will need something to catch the process of php - and link that to your editor - so you can step through your code. Something Chrome's browser inspector does for JS - since its all in the browser.

To set up debugging in PHP, we use x-debug. You can install PHP-FPM so you can switch between each version of PHP - so you can develop for 5.6 and the different flavors of PHP 7. Each version if PHP you install, you will want to install X-Debug. Once that is installed/configured , you can use the following VS Code extension.

I still play with Node.js as a server-side  - I imagine it's simialr obstacle for debugging.
