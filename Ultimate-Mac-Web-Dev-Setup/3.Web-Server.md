# Ultimate Mac Web Dev Setup

[Back to Start](readme.md)

## Part 3: Web Server

## Local Web Server

### Set Up Apache and Multiple PHP instances
We want to overide deault Apache and PHP, as well as support multiple PHP environments. Some legacy projects for example.

Follow Instructions here:

https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-sierra-apache-multiple-php-versions

note:
1. You can point the server to any folder on your system. I have a folder for all of my sites in a particular folder for example.
2. Set Default Time zone in each php.ini file.

```
date.timezone = "America/Los_Angeles"
```

3. MySQL - use my installation below instead.
It looks to install MariaDB which is an alternative to MySQL. In practice does not look like you would see a difference.

4. Virtual Hosts Config

    https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-mojave-apache-mysql-vhost-apc

    a. Change the Include path for #Virtual hosts.

    I ignored the Include /usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

    ```
    # Virtual hosts
    # Include /usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
    Include /usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/vhosts/*.conf
    ```

    > Note: This wildcard lets us set up a conf file for each project. (e.g. Any file that ends in .conf).
    > You could put everything in one file, but this is nicer for me. and more portable.
    > Easy to disable by changing .conf to .disabled for example.

    b. Inside of `/usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/vhosts/` create localhost.conf

    > This sets up a default server  - I like to point this to the root of all sites so I can test just normal web server stuff. phpinfo for example, as you will see.

    ```
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName localhost
        DocumentRoot "/Users/USERNAME/WebServer/Sites"
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

5. Faster: Install APCu, Yaml and Xdebug together on each PHP version - see the "Advanced Techniques" which combines them all into single commands.

    > * APCu when asked to log, say no. (not entirely sure why, but worked for me).
    > * Yaml - when hit with autodetect, press enter.
    > * xdebug: Should only be enabled when using to speed up development. xdebug on | xdebug off.

6. Skip [Optional] APCu Configuration

### Common Apache Commands
Commands for managing Apache do not change (-k flag will force a restart immediately rather than asking politely to restart when apache is good and ready)
```
sudo apachectl start
sudo apachectl stop
sudo apachectl -k restart
sudo apachectl configtest
```

## Vhosts With Common/Shared SSL

This gave me some trouble, here are some things to look out for:

1. Wildcard SSL shared by all.

Common Name is the most important piece to fill out. If you use Wildcard (asterisk) it will allow this cert to be used by all.
Originally I tried creating a cert for each, but this is much simpler. less work for each new project.

Example data to fill in. The following will allow for anything that ends in .com `*.com`. Feel free to be more accurate to where site is hosted? They say it did not matter, but I have not weighed out the pros and cons of using Ohio for example, even though I am located in LA. Quoting is unnecessary and will actually take it literally.

```
Country Name (2 letter code) []:US
State or Province Name (full name) []:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Los Angeles
Organization Name (eg, company) []:Company Name
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Company Team
Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:*.com
Email Address []:meatch@me.com
```

2. Configuring SSL Conf Sample

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName local.enspyred.com

    DocumentRoot "/Users/USERNAME/WebServer/Sites/Path/To/Website"
    <Directory /Users/USERNAME/WebServer/Sites/Path/To/Website>
        Require all granted
        Options Includes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog "/Users/USERNAME/WebServer/LOGS/local.site.com/error.log"
    CustomLog "/Users/USERNAME/WebServer/LOGS/local.site.com/access.log" common
    ServerAdmin meatch@me.com
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName local.enspyred.com

    DocumentRoot "/Users/USERNAME/WebServer/Sites/Path/To/Website"
    <Directory /Users/USERNAME/WebServer/Sites/Path/To/Website>
        Require all granted
        Options Includes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog "/Users/USERNAME/WebServer/LOGS/local.site.com/error.log"
    CustomLog "/Users/USERNAME/WebServer/LOGS/local.site.com/access.log" common
    ServerAdmin meatch@me.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile "/usr/local/etc/httpd/server.crt"
    SSLCertificateKeyFile "/usr/local/etc/httpd/server.key"
</VirtualHost>
```


## MySQL

@TODO: Update this to install in `/usr/local/etc` like PHP, HTPD, OPENSSL? Would be nice to keep everything in one folder.

1. Install MySQL
    `brew install mysql`

2. Brew Services: Lets you start up services
    `brew tap homebrew/services`

3. Start MYSQL
    `brew services start mysql`

4. Set Up Local User and Pass (exchange yourpassword with Your Password)
    `mysqladmin -u root password 'yourpassword'`
